# Worldle

Welcome to the Worldle Game! This is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a five-letter
word within a limited number of attempts. The game is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern UI
toolkit for Android app development.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game all the boxes in the game board are empty. Now your task is to guess a 5
   letter word.
2. Enter your guess by tapping on the letter buttons displayed on the screen. The letters will be
   filled in the appropriate positions.
3. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word. With each incorrect guess, you'll
   receive feedback indicating which letters are correctly positioned (marked with a green
   background) and which letters are present in the word but in the wrong position (marked with a
   yellow background).
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word within the given attempts or until you run out
   of attempts.
5. After the game ends, you'll have the option to play again by tapping the "Play Again" button.

## Customization

mechanics.
